# ML Inference API 🚀

A production-style **Machine Learning Inference API** that demonstrates how trained ML models can be deployed and served using a clean, scalable REST architecture.  
This project focuses on **ML system design, API development, and deployment best practices** rather than model complexity.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Machine learning models are only useful when they can be reliably deployed and consumed by applications.  
This project shows how to take an ML model and expose it as a **real-time inference service** using FastAPI.

The system:
- Loads a trained ML model
- Serves predictions via a REST API
- Returns confidence scores
- Uses a modular design to easily swap models
